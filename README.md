# Bits and Pages

This repository collects programming books and guides. The primary goal is to maintain a central place for downloadable study material.

## Structure

- `Guides/` – General folder for reference material. Subdirectories may be created for different languages or topics.
  - `MoureDev Guides [ES]/` – PDFs covering Java fundamentals, JavaScript fundamentals, Python fundamentals and a glossary of programming terminology.

The structure is intentionally simple to allow for future additions. As more books and guides are gathered—either in Spanish or English—new folders will be added to keep things organized.

## Contributing

For now, contributions are welcome by adding new guides in appropriate language folders. If you plan to include a large collection or propose a new structure, feel free to open an issue to discuss.
